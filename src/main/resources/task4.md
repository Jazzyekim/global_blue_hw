## Team Mobile Farm

## Objective:
Estimate the annual costs of operating a mobile test farm that supports both iOS

existing framework that can execute parallel mobile tests on any Appium setup.
Requirements:
1. Device Types: Include both iOS and Android devices.
2. Parallel Sessions: Support 5 parallel test sessions.
3. Teams: The farm should serve two teams at the same time.
4. Cost Estimates: Provide cost estimates for:
