## Integration Possibilities:
TestRail can be integrated with both Jenkins freestyle and pipeline jobs:
1. Setting up TestRail -> Enable API
2. Configuring Jenkins jobs to include script that interact with the TestRail API using [TestRail CLI](https://support.testrail.com/hc/en-us/articles/7146548750868-Overview-and-installation).
3. Mapping test case IDs in Jenkins test results to their counterparts in TestRail.
